# ProBrws (Processing Browser and Web Server)
This is a custom Browser and Web Server with it's own dedicated markup language called PML.

## Getting started
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/plopez01/proBrws/wiki) on how to use any of the features, and the PML documentation.

## Targeted features are:
- ~~Load PML pages locally~~ | Done
- ~~Load PML externally~~ | Done
- Image transfer across the web | Done but needs optimization. Check out [#6](https://github.com/plopez01/proBrws/issues/6).
- Server CLI | Todo
- Custom domain name system | Todo

### *Maybe I implement these:*
- Browser multi tab system
- Extended full PML lang (more tags, links, animations)
- Full style and script support
- Video transfer
